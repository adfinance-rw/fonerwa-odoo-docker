# SSL Certificates

This project now uses Let's Encrypt certificates managed by a `certbot` container.

Paths inside the Nginx container:
- Certificate: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-domain>/fullchain.pem`
- Private key: `/etc/letsencrypt/live/<your-domain>/privkey.pem`

The host directories are mounted at `./certbot/conf` and `./certbot/www`.

## First-time issuance

Set your domain and optional email, then deploy:

```bash
export DOMAIN=odoo.greenfund.rw
export CERTBOT_EMAIL=you@example.com   # optional
export CERTBOT_STAGING=1               # optional (use staging first)
./scripts/deploy.sh
```

The script will:
- Bootstrap a temporary self-signed cert so Nginx can start
- Request a real certificate via HTTP-01 (webroot)
- Reload Nginx upon success

## Renewal

The `certbot` service runs a renewal loop (`certbot renew`) every 12h. Nginx uses live paths so renewed certs are picked up on reload (you can trigger reload as needed).

## Development

For pure local development without a public domain, you can skip Let's Encrypt and rely on the temporary certificate generated by the deploy script.
